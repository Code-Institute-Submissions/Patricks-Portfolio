# Patricks-Portfolio
Milestone 1 Project 


I have chosen to create a portfolio I can continuously add to throughout my education with Code Institute. I felt this this was the best option on the project examples list and better again than selecting my own project at random as I can add future projects or side work to the portfolio as my experience grows.
The Portfolio features a custom navbar menu which users can use to navigate to 5 areas on the page.



UX
This website will be a reference point for potential future employers. Therefore it will it will need to showcase my capabilities in an aesthetically pleasing fashion. From an employers perspective they will not only want to see that the website its self is functional, but that the my content will be relative to positions I desire.

This website is:
Easy to navigate.
Steps the potential employer through legible information.
Gives the employers the information they need without overloading them.
Guiding them to the goal of the website - to fill out the contact form.

Features
The website features a navigation bar which appears once the user begins to scroll.
From there, the menu lists 5 areas of the page. A smooth scroll function will carry the user to the selected area on the page.
The navigation bar also includes button which can be used to download a CV.

An animated hero image opens the page followed by a coding quote.
The introduction section briefly describes what the website contains. Below this I have added some contact details.
Past projects is a section whereby users can view brief description of websites I have built and by clicking the heading they will be brought to the site on a new tab.

A carousel section was added from bootstrap to animate the page while showing my education experience through imagery and captions.

A frequently asked question section features a dropdown bar for the answers of each question.

The last section is a contact form followed by links to social media sites.

Technologies Used
JavaScript has been implemented for scrolling from the navigation menu and the carousel in the Education section.


Testing

I have tested the Navigation bar to ensure all links carry the user to the correct area of the page with the scroll function working adequately/

I have tested the Download CV button which works although I have not added a document to the link.

All links on the website are fully functional and will take the user to the specified site through a new tab.

The contact form provides an error message if filled incorrectly.

The site has been tested for responsiveness on Chrome, Opera, Fireforx, Iphone Xr and Samsung Galaxy.


Deployment
The project has been deployed through Github.

Photos were sourced from Google images.
Code for areas such as the carousel and navigation bar were sourced through bootstrap and custom CSS.
